# Disease detection API for MediSearch
An API that uses NLP and AI to let you predict possible diseases and symptoms based on a prompt of what you're feeling.

## Available routes
This app only has one route `/get_illness` that lets you enter a prompt of how you're feeling, your age and sex and get possible diseases and symptoms. You can see it in action in the `/docs` route.
